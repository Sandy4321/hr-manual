# Policy Manual

Last Updated: August 24, 2016

## Our Mission
We open up laws, legislation, and the lawmaking process online so that as many people as possible can see, understand, and shape the policies that affect their lives.


## Vision
We are former and current government workers, designers, technologists, and concerned citizens who believe in building with, not for, and in partnering directly with users both in and outside of government to find solutions that help bridge the gap between the two. We're focused on long-term solutions, building tools and processes that change the culture of how governments operate.

Everything we create is open source, free for anyone to take and use.

We're building a national network of people like us and the Free Law Founders—to share resources and expertise around solving shared challenges in modernizing the lawmaking process.


## Culture & Compliance

### Equal Employment Opportunity Disclosure & Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
The OpenGov Foundation is committed to equal employment opportunity.  We will not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on any legally recognized basis including, but not limited to race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, or any other protected class under federal, state or local law, *as well as* gender identity, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing.  We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to qualified individuals with disabilities.  This may include providing reasonable accommodation where appropriate in order for an otherwise qualified individual to perform the essential functions of the job.

### Harassment, Bullying, Violence in the Workplace Policy
We prohibit harassment of one employee by another employee, supervisor or third party for any reason based on a protected class including but not limited to: veteran status, uniform member status, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability genetic information or any other protected class under federal, state or local law, *as well as* gender identity, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing. Harassment of third parties by our employees is also prohibited.

The following are considered a protected class: race; religious creed; color; national origin; ancestry; physical disability; mental disability; medical condition, including genetic characteristics; marital status; sex; pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions; actual or perceived gender; gender identity; sexual orientation; civil air patrol membership; service in the military forces and age (40 or over). Included in the definition of each protected category is the perception of membership in a protected category and an individual's association with an actual or perceived member of a protected category.

The purpose of this policy is not to regulate the personal morality of employees. It is to ensure that in the workplace, no employee harasses another for any reason or in any manner. The conduct prohibited by this policy includes conduct in any form including but not limited to e-mail, voice mail, chat rooms, social networking, internet use or history, text messages, pictures, images, writings, words or gestures.

While it is not easy to define precisely what harassment is, it includes: slurs, epithets, threats, derogatory comments or visual depictions, unwelcome jokes and teasing. For reasonable guidelines on harassment and boundaries, please read [18F's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [GSA's Policy on Harassment](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/663070).


Any employee who believes that (s)he has been harassed should report the situation immediately to one of the following members of management: Executive Director, Treasurer or Chairman of the Board of Directors. If an employee makes a report to any of these members of management and the manager either does not respond or does not respond in a manner the employee deems satisfactory or consistent with this policy, the employee is required to report the situation to one of the other members of management designated in this policy to receive complaints.

The company will investigate all such reports as confidentially as possible. Adverse action will not be taken against an employee because he or she, in good faith, reports or participates in the investigation of a violation of this policy. Violations of this policy are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.


### Drug & Alcohol-Free Workplace Statement
The unlawful or improper presence or use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace presents a danger to all employees.  Employees are prohibited from reporting to work or working while using illegal or unauthorized substances.

### Conflict of Interest
A company's reputation for integrity is its most valuable asset and is directly related to the conduct of its employees.  Therefore, employees must never use their positions with the company for private gain, to advance personal interests or to obtain favors or benefits for themselves, member of their families or any other individuals, corporations of business entities.

### Professional Conduct
The company adheres to the highest legal and ethical standards applicable in our business.  The company's business is conducted in strict observance of both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws and the integrity of each employee is of utmost importance.

## Schedule, Hours & Vacation

### Our Schedule

Employees are expected to work 40 hours per week, but we are flexible on where and when that work gets done.

Employees are expected to attend all meetings to which they have been invited as a "required" participant. Communication is vital to the success of our team; therefore, team members are expected to be reasonably accessible by phone, Slack, and email between the hours of 11 AM–4 PM.

Employees are able to work from home and/or remotely and the organization will make all efforts to ensure a comparable work experience regardless of where an employee is located.

Any time that you won't be available during the regular work day (9 PM to 5 PM locally) should be put on your calendar the organization's calendar.

### Vacation & Leave Policy
We are closed on all [Federal holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/holidays-work-schedules-and-pay), the day after Thanksgiving, and during the week between Christmas and the New Year.  We also have a few additional days off, please see [the attached holidays list](holidays.md).

We expect everyone to be able to get their work done in a timely fashion, and to not have to work on personal time.  Rested and refreshed people are better team members, and we strongly encourage enjoying life outside of the office.  

*Employees should take a minimum of two weeks of paid vacation per year, totaling 10 business days.*

For personal, medical, or family leave, each employee is encouraged to take the current [Family and Medical Leave Act](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla) maximum.

For maternity and paternity leave, employees are encouraged to take up to 16 weeks of leave.

#### Taking Leave
Employees must inform your supervisor in writing as far in advance as is reasonable for staff and project planning purposes.  All extended periods of leave must be discussed with the Executive Director.

To schedule time off, permission must be granted by your supervisor no less than 5 business days in advance, the dates your travel must be put onto the team calendar, and the team should be notified via email.

### Sick Days
Please notify the team if you are sick and need to take the day off. Even if you are feeling well enough to work, please work from home until you are completely recovered, to avoid spreading illness through our small office.

## How We Work

### Email Accounts, Document Sharing & Password Sharing
We will set you up with an organizational Google Suite account.  This will provide you access to all the basic necessities like email, calendar, and shared storage.  

Please use your organizational email address for all work-related correspondence, scheduling, etc.  Personal accounts should not be used for work-related activities.

You will be granted access to our shared passwords in Passpack.  All passwords that need to be shared with the organization must be shared using Passpack or a secure service such as [Toaster](https://fugacious.18f.gov/). Passwords should not be shared via email or other insecure methods.

### Calendars
Please keep your availability updated on your Google calendar account associated with the organization - please don't use your personal account.  Please record any meetings, vacation time, appointments, and anything else that your teammates might need to schedule around.  Feel free to schedule meetings with other coworkers on the Google calendar.

### Regular Meetings
All meetings must be held in a manner that allows for full participation of all employees, regardless of such individual variables such as geographic location.

#### Daily Standup(s)
To better coordinate organizational or product development efforts, one or more daily standups may be scheduled, each lasting no longer than 20 minutes.  

The sole purpose of the daily standup is to provide a short summary of what you focused on the previous day, what you are planning on focusing on today, and, critically, identification of any obstacles or blockers that may prevent you from completing a task.  

Once each participate has completed their summary, the standup may be ended.  Should a topic be raised that requires more in depth discussion, a separate meeting should be scheduled.

#### Weekly All Hands
We meet once a week as a complete team for no more than 30 minutes to discuss organization-level topics, share important updates, and, most importantly, celebrate our work through informal talks or product demos.  Should a topic be raised that requires more in depth discussion, a separate meeting should be scheduled.

Participation in the weekly standup is required of all organization employees and must allow for the full participation of all employees regardless of geographic location.

#### Book Clubs, "Family" Meals, and Other Informal Rituals
We are a small, close knit team.  To maintain a balanced, healthy, and fun organization, we encourage the formation of informal gatherings and groups. Any employee my sponsor an informal gathering or group so as long it is are open to all employees and supports organizational health.  

As in any endeavor, it is critical that any informal gathering or group clearly define its purpose and the expectation placed upon its participants.
